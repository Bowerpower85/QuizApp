# QuizApp

This Quiz application was built so the user could test their general knowledge of JavaScript. As soon as the user presses the start button a contdown timer is activated. The user is presented with a question and multiple answers to choose from. If they choose correctly there is an indicator as the text area turns green, If however the user answers incorrectly the text area turns red. To add to the pressure if the user answers incorrectly extra time is run off the clock. When the user has answered all the questions or the time has run out the game is over and the user is taken to a page where they can save their initials and score. In the future it would be nice to change the JavaScript to add more question and even leverage an api to genewrate random question to be added to the quiz.
